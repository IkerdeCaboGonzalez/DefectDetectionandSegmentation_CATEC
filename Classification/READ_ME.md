In this script, we train a set of pretrained models (VGG16, ConvNeXt, ResNet18, and DenseNet) for defect detection (binary classification: defect/no defect). The models were trained to detect defects in component inspections carried out using computed tomography. In the .py file you can find a function made to charge the images for the training from the respective directories, while making a cut so that information from the borders (like date of inspection, spatial coordinates) are not used by the models.
