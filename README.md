Work done in my time in CATEC as part of the project to create a complete workflow to detect defects in an automized way through the use IA. The scripts are organized as followed:

-1: Defect detection and reconstruction through a encoder-decoder network.
-2: Defect detection through a CNN.
-3: Reconstruction of deefects from imagen from the previous CNN.
