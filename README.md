Work done in my time in CATEC as part of the project to create a complete workflow to detect defects in an automized way through the use IA. The scripts are organized as followed:

1: Deteccion_defectos: Script where we train models to do binary detection (images with defects/ images without defects). We use transfer learning to adapt pretrained models to fit our task.

2: Reconstruccion_defectos:
